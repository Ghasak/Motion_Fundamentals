# Motion Fundamentals

A developed 2D engine to describe the motion of objects in 2D plan.
including vector space, Motion laws, Collisions and many others.
The motion fundamentals is used to develope all the simulators which are necessary
for modeling the motion of objects in 2D plan.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Simulator Output

I have used Python3.7 Anaconda. and pygame 1.9.6
